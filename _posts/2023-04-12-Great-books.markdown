On Computer Systems:
 - [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective][csappbook]. This is a book every programmer should read.

On Operating Systems:
 - [Operating Systems - Three Easy Pieces][ostep]. Very good introductory book available for free online.

On Computer Networks:
 - [Computer Networking: a Top Down Approach][cntopdown]. Very good introductory book. Unlike other books on Computer Networks, authors start their exposition from the application level instead of the link layer. For a more in-depth material, Steven's books are classics.

On Probability Theory:
 - [Probability Theory: The Logic of Science, Jaynes][jaynesprob]. Very interesting exposition of Bayesian approach to probability theory. Requires basic knowledge of probability and uni-level math. Definitely not for beginners.

On Classical Mechanics:
 - [Science of Mechanics, Mach][machmech]. Insightful book on the history of the development of mechanics. Interesting critique of Newton's ideas. Not for complete beginners. English translation is a bit archaic.
